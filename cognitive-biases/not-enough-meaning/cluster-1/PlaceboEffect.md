# Placebo effect bias

## 1. Context and Literature State of the Art

**Wikipedia:**
A placebo effect is the tendency of any `medication` or `treatment`, even an `inert` or `ineffective` one, to exhibit results simply because the recipient believes that it will work.

## 2. Large Language Models (LLMs)

***2.1 - Let's ask ChatGPT for a generic definition, just to get an idea of the domain.***

**Give me a definition of "Placebo effect"**

The "Placebo effect" bias refers to a cognitive bias in which an individual experiences a perceived `improvement` in their `condition` or `symptoms` after receiving a `treatment` or `intervention` that has no `therapeutic` `effect`. This bias occurs due to the `individual`'s `belief` in the treatment's `effectiveness`, often stemming from their `expectations`, beliefs, or cultural `influences`. The placebo effect bias can lead to a genuine `psychological` or `physiological` response, even though the treatment itself lacks any direct therapeutic properties. It highlights the power of the `mind-body` connection and the influence of psychological factors on perceived `health` outcomes.

***2.2 - Let's ask to give us some examples of possible scenarios to better understand the context***

**Give me 10 example scenarios of "Placebo effect"**

Certainly, here are ten example scenarios that illustrate the "Placebo Effect":

1. **Sugar Pill:** A patient is given a sugar pill by a doctor, believing it to be a powerful pain-relieving medication. The patient's `pain` subsides after taking the pill, even though the `pill` has no active ingredients.

2. **Fake Acupuncture:** A person undergoes a session of acupuncture using `fake` needles that don't penetrate the skin. They report feeling less anxious and more relaxed after the session, attributing the `improvement` to the treatment.

3. **Homeopathic Remedy:** Someone takes a `homeopathic` `remedy` for their cold `symptoms`, despite the remedy containing only highly diluted substances. They experience a perceived reduction in their symptoms and credit the homeopathic treatment.

4. **Positive Affirmations:** An individual repeats positive affirmations daily, believing they will improve their mood. Over time, their overall outlook becomes more `positive`, although the affirmations themselves have no physiological effect.

5. **Lucky Charm:** A sports player wears a lucky charm `believing` it will `enhance` their performance. Despite the charm having no real influence, the player's confidence increases, leading to improved performance on the field.

6. **Cultural Ritual:** A person participates in a traditional healing ritual that involves chanting and herbal `remedies`. They notice an improvement in their symptoms due to the psychological impact of the ritual, despite the lack of scientific basis.

7. **Alternative Medicine:** A patient with chronic pain undergoes a series of alternative treatments, such as reiki or energy healing. They report feeling better and attribute their improvement to the alternative therapies, even though the mechanisms are unproven.

8. **Placebo Surgery:** In a clinical trial, a group of patients undergoes a placebo surgery where no actual surgical procedure is performed. Some patients still experience relief from their condition, believing they received a genuine intervention.

9. **Vitamin Supplements:** An individual takes vitamin supplements with the expectation of boosting their energy levels. They feel more energized and attribute it to the supplements, even though their diet already provided sufficient nutrients.

10. **Fake Pain Cream:** A cream with no active ingredients is applied to a person's sore muscles. They experience a temporary reduction in pain due to their belief in the cream's effectiveness.

In each of these scenarios, the "Placebo Effect" is observed as individuals experience perceived improvements in their condition or well-being due to their beliefs, expectations, or cultural influences, even when the treatment itself lacks actual therapeutic properties.

***2.3 - Let's ask for some user story and competency questions***

**Consider the scenario "Positive Affirmations" and give me a small user story from it**

**User Story: Embracing Positivity Through Affirmations**

In my pursuit of personal growth, I began a daily `practice` of positive affirmations. Every morning, I repeated phrases like "I am capable" and "I attract positivity." Over time, I noticed a `shift` in my mindset. When faced with challenges, I drew on these affirmations, `feeling` more `confident` and `resilient`. During a nerve-wracking work presentation, my affirmations helped me stay composed and `confident`, leading to a successful outcome. This experience showed me the real influence of positive thoughts on my outlook and how simple practices can empower me to face situations with newfound strength.

***We can now derive CQs from the user story***

* CQ1: How can individuals distinguish between genuine improvements in health or well-being and instances where perceived benefits are primarily driven by the placebo effect bias?
* CQ2: What cognitive and psychological mechanisms underlie the placebo effect bias, leading individuals to experience actual improvements in their condition based on their beliefs and expectations?
* CQ3: How do cultural beliefs and societal norms contribute to the placebo effect bias, and how can healthcare providers navigate these influences to provide effective care?

***2.4 - Let's now ask about modeling this bias for an ontology***

**If you should make an ontology of the "Placebo effect", what classes and properties would you create?**

**Classes:**

1. **CognitiveBias:** Represents various types of biases, including the system justification bias. This class serves as a superclass for specific types of biases such as confirmation bias, availability bias, and more.
2. **PlaceboEffect:**The overarching concept representing the cognitive bias where an individual experiences perceived improvements in their condition or symptoms due to their beliefs, expectations, or cultural influences, even when the treatment itself lacks direct therapeutic properties.
3. **PlaceboResponses:** Subclass of PlaceboEffect that delves deeper into the various physiological, psychological, and subjective responses that individuals may experience as a result of the placebo effect bias.
4. **EducationalInterventions:**Represents efforts to educate healthcare professionals about the placebo effect bias, enabling them to ethically and effectively manage patient expectations.
5. **MediaandPlaceboInfluence::** Addresses how media portrayals and advertisements can impact the placebo effect bias by shaping public perceptions of treatments and interventions.
6. **PsychosomaticMedicine:** Focuses on the interplay between psychological factors and physical health, particularly in cases where the placebo effect bias plays a significant role.

**Properties:**

1. **perceivedImprovement:** Relates an individual to their reported positive changes in symptoms or well-being as a result of the placebo effect bias.
2. **beliefInTreatment:** Connects individuals to their belief in the effectiveness of a treatment or intervention, which contributes to the placebo effect bias.
3. **expectationOfChange:** Represents an individual's anticipation of improvement in their condition based on their belief in the treatment's efficacy.
4. **mindBodyConnection:** Illustrates the connection between an individual's psychological state, such as positive thoughts and expectations, and its impact on physiological responses.
5. **culturalInfluences:** Relates to an individual's competence in critically assessing media messages and trends to avoid blindly conforming to the bandwagon effect.Relates to how cultural norms, societal beliefs, and traditional practices influence an individual's susceptibility to the placebo effect bias.
7. **neurobiologicalMechanisms:** Represents the underlying brain processes and neural pathways involved in mediating the placebo effect bias.
8. **ethicalConsiderations:** Focuses on the ethical implications of utilizing or inducing the placebo effect bias in medical or therapeutic contexts, including informed consent and patient well-being.
9. **psychosocialContext:**  Explores the role of social support, patient-provider relationships, and psychosocial factors in influencing the placebo effect bias.

This ontology structure outlines specific classes and properties that characterize various aspects of the "Placebo Effect," from beliefs and expectations to neurobiological mechanisms, cultural influences, and clinical considerations. It provides a structured framework for analyzing and understanding the complexities of this cognitive bias and its implications in healthcare and beyond.


***2.5 - Let's ask for some example of usage of the ontology***

**Can you give me three examples of usage of this classes and properties?**

*Example 1: Patient-Provider Interaction and Placebo Responses*

Class: Patient-Provider Interaction

Properties:

beliefInTreatment
psychosocialContext
Scenario: A patient visits a healthcare provider with chronic pain. The provider explains that they will receive a new experimental treatment known for its pain-relieving effects. The patient, trusting their provider's expertise, develops a strong belief in the treatment's effectiveness. During the course of treatment, the patient's psychosocial context, including their positive expectations and trust in the provider, contributes to the placebo response. The patient experiences significant pain reduction, attributing it to the treatment, despite its lack of therapeutic properties.

*Example 2: Placebo by Condition and Genetics*

Class: Placebo by Condition

Properties:

placeboResponses
geneticAndIndividualVariability
Scenario: In a clinical trial for depression, researchers observe that patients with a specific genetic variant show higher placebo responses compared to those without the variant. This suggests that genetic factors contribute to the variability of the placebo effect bias in treating mental health conditions. The placebo response in patients with the genetic variant is likely influenced by their neurobiology and individual psychological factors, highlighting the complexity of the interaction between genetics and the placebo effect.

*Example 3: Placebo in Traditional Medicine and Cultural Influences*

Class: Placebo in Traditional Medicine

Properties:

culturalInfluences
ethnopharmacologyAndPlacebos
Scenario: A community practices a traditional healing ritual involving the use of herbs and chants for treating common ailments. Over generations, the ritual has become culturally embedded, leading individuals to develop strong beliefs in its effectiveness. This cultural influence and the psychosocial context of the ritual contribute to the placebo effect bias, where community members experience perceived improvements in their health. The placebo response in this context is shaped by the interplay between cultural beliefs, expectations, and the power of the mind-body connection.

These examples demonstrate how the classes and properties from the ontology can be applied in different contexts, from patient-provider interactions and genetic influences on placebo responses, to the role of cultural practices and traditional medicine in shaping the placebo effect bias. The ontology provides a structured framework for understanding and analyzing the complexities of the "Placebo Effect" and its multifaceted implications.
