# Stereotyping bias

## 1. Context and Literature State of the Art

**Wikipedia:**
Stereotyping is a generalized belief about a particular category of people. It is an `expectation` that people might have about every person of a particular group. The type of expectation can vary; it can be, for example, an expectation about the group's personality, preferences, appearance or ability. Stereotypes are sometimes `overgeneralized`, `inaccurate`, and resistant to new information, but can sometimes be accurate.

## 2. Large Language Models (LLMs)

***2.1 - Let's ask ChatGPT for a generic definition, just to get an idea of the domain.***

**Give me a definition of "Stereotyping"**

Stereotyping bias refers to a cognitive bias in which individuals make `generalizations` or `assumptions` about a group of people based on certain `characteristics`, `attributes`, or `traits` that are believed to be `associated` with that group. This bias can lead to the `oversimplification` and often `inaccurate` `perception` of individuals within the group, ignoring their `unique` qualities and treating them as if they all `conform` to the same `preconceived` notions. Stereotyping bias can contribute to unfair `judgments`, `discrimination`, and the perpetuation of social `inequalities`, as it fails to consider the `diversity` and complexity present within any group.

***2.2 - Let's ask to give us some examples of possible scenarios to better understand the context***

**Give me 10 example scenarios of "Stereotyping"**

Certainly, here are ten example scenarios that illustrate instances of stereotyping bias:

1. **Gender Roles:** Assuming that women are not as capable in technical fields as men, leading to the `underrepresentation` of women in STEM professions.

2. **Racial Profiling:** Law enforcement disproportionately stopping and questioning individuals from certain `racial` or `ethnic` `backgrounds` based on `stereotypes` about criminal behavior.

3. **Age Discrimination:** Believing that older adults are technologically inept and unable to adapt to new devices or software, leading to `exclusion` from digital platforms.

4. **Nationality Stereotypes:** Assuming that individuals from a specific country are all exceptionally good at math, `neglecting` the fact that mathematical abilities vary among individuals.

5. **Body Image Stereotypes:** Associating thinness with beauty and attractiveness, leading to negative body image and unrealistic beauty `standards`.

6. **Occupational Stereotypes:** Assuming that nurses are always female and doctors are always male, disregarding the `diversity` of gender representation in both professions.

7. **Religious Stereotyping:** Assuming that individuals from a particular religion hold specific `political` views or `cultural` practices, `oversimplifying` their beliefs and `values`.

8. **LGBTQ+ Stereotypes:** Assuming that all gay men are fashionable and interested in makeup, neglecting the wide range of interests and `personalities` within the LGBTQ+ community.

9. **Disability Stereotypes:** Believing that individuals with disabilities are inherently dependent and incapable of achieving certain goals, limiting their `opportunities` for personal growth.

10. **Economic Stereotypes:** Assuming that individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds are less intelligent or hardworking than those from higher socioeconomic backgrounds, perpetuating social class inequalities.

In each of these scenarios, stereotyping bias results in generalizations and assumptions about individuals based on their membership in a particular group, often leading to unfair treatment, missed opportunities, and reinforcing harmful societal norms.

***2.3 - Let's ask for some user story and competency questions***

**Consider the scenario "Religious Stereotyping" and give me a small user story from it**

**User Story: Overcoming Religious Stereotyping**

In a community dialogue, I confronted the issue of religious stereotyping. When a participant made a sweeping statement about a religious group's political `beliefs`, I shared how my friend, who followed that religion, had diverse `views`. This sparked a discussion on the danger of assuming uniformity within any group. By sharing personal stories, we challenged biases and committed to fostering a more open and respectful community that values `individual` experiences over `generalizations`. This experience highlighted the impact of confronting religious stereotypes through dialogue and empathy.

***We can now derive CQs from the user story***

* CQ1: What role does empathy play in breaking down stereotypical beliefs, and how can individuals actively engage in conversations and experiences that challenge and counteract these biases?
* CQ2: How can education and awareness campaigns effectively address and mitigate the impact of stereotyping biases, particularly in schools, workplaces, and public spaces, to promote inclusivity and diversity?
* CQ3: What are the potential consequences of relying on stereotypes when making judgments or decisions about individuals, and how can awareness of this bias lead to more fair and equitable outcomes?

***2.4 - Let's now ask about modeling this bias for an ontology***

**If you should make an ontology of the "Stereotyping", what classes and properties would you create?**

**Classes:**

1. **CognitiveBias:** Represents various types of biases, including the system justification bias. This class serves as a superclass for specific types of biases such as confirmation bias, availability bias, and more.
2. **Stereotyping:** The overarching concept representing the cognitive bias where individuals make generalizations or assumptions about a group of people based on certain characteristics, attributes, or traits associated with that group.
3. **StereotypeThreat:** Focuses specifically on the concept of stereotype threat, where individuals feel pressure to conform to negative stereotypes about their group, leading to anxiety and underperformance.
4. **MediaRepresentation:** Explores how media representation of different groups contributes to the formation and reinforcement of stereotypes, and the potential impact on public perception.
5. **IntergroupContact:** Addresses the role of direct interactions between individuals from different groups in challenging and reducing stereotypical beliefs.
6. **CognitiveDissonance:** Investigates the psychological discomfort that individuals may experience when their attitudes or behaviors conflict with stereotypical beliefs.
7. **CulturalCompetence:** Focuses on the development of cultural awareness, sensitivity, and effective communication skills to navigate and challenge stereotypes in diverse contexts.

**Properties:**

1. **targetGroup:** Relates stereotyping instances to the specific group of people that the bias is directed towards.
2. **characteristicAttributes:** Represents the attributes, traits, or characteristics that are often associated with the target group in stereotypical thinking.
3. **cognitiveMechanisms:** Illustrates the psychological processes and cognitive shortcuts that contribute to the formation and reinforcement of stereotypes.
4. **mediaInfluence:** Addresses the role of media, including its portrayal of certain groups, in shaping and perpetuating stereotypes.
5. **intersectionalityConsiderations:** Relates to how intersecting factors such as race, gender, sexuality, and socioeconomic status complicate and influence the formation of stereotypes.
6. **stereotypeThreat:** Represents the concept of stereotype threat, where individuals may internalize and perform in accordance with negative stereotypes about their group.
7. **counterStereotyping:** Focuses on efforts to challenge and counteract stereotypes through education, awareness, and intergroup contact.
8. **culturalContext:** Illustrates how cultural norms, historical contexts, and societal influences contribute to the development and persistence of stereotypes.
9. **prejudiceAndDiscrimination:** Connects stereotypes to broader concepts of prejudice and discrimination, exploring how stereotypes contribute to biased attitudes and unequal treatment.


This ontology structure outlines specific classes and properties that characterize various aspects of "Stereotyping," from its cognitive mechanisms and media influences to its ethical implications and potential interventions. It provides a structured framework for analyzing and understanding the complexities of this cognitive bias and its implications in various domains of human interaction.

***2.5 - Let's ask for some example of usage of the ontology***

**Can you give me three examples of usage of this classes and properties?**

*Example 1: Media Representation and Stereotypes*

Class: Media Representation

Properties:

impactOnStereotypes
culturalContext
Scenario: A research study examines the portrayal of a specific ethnic group in mainstream media over the past decade. By analyzing television shows, movies, and news coverage, researchers identify consistent stereotypes associated with this group, such as criminality and poverty. The media's portrayal contributes to the persistence of these stereotypes, shaping public perceptions and attitudes. The study considers the cultural context and historical factors that influence the media's representation of this group.

*Example 2: Implicit Bias and Cognitive Mechanisms*

Class: Implicit Bias

Properties:

unconsciousAssociations
impactOnDecisions
Scenario: In a hiring process, a manager unconsciously associates women with caregiving roles and men with leadership positions. As a result, the manager may unintentionally favor male candidates for leadership roles, perpetuating gender-based stereotypes. This implicit bias influences the manager's decision-making, leading to unequal opportunities for candidates based on their gender. The scenario highlights the cognitive mechanisms of automatic associations and their impact on real-world decisions.

*Example 3: Stereotype Threat and Educational Interventions*

Class: Stereotype Threat

Properties:

anxietyAndUnderperformance
counterStereotyping
Scenario: In an academic setting, students from underrepresented backgrounds experience stereotype threat related to their math abilities. They fear conforming to the stereotype that their group is not good at math, leading to increased anxiety and underperformance in math exams. The school implements educational interventions that create a supportive environment, emphasize growth mindset, and provide diverse role models in math-related fields. These interventions aim to mitigate stereotype threat, boost confidence, and improve academic outcomes.

These examples demonstrate how the classes and properties from the ontology can be applied in different contexts, from media representation influencing stereotypes and implicit bias affecting decision-making, to stereotype threat in education and the implementation of interventions to challenge and counteract stereotypical beliefs. The ontology provides a structured framework for analyzing and understanding the multifaceted nature of "Stereotyping" and its impact on various aspects of society.
