# Decoy Effect

*## CLUSTER: To avoid mistakes, we aim to preserve autonomy and group status and avoid irreversible decisions*

## 1. Context and Literature State of the Art

**Wikipedia:**
In marketing, the decoy effect (or attraction effect or asymmetric dominance effect) is the phenomenon whereby consumers will tend to have a specific change in preference between two options when also presented with a third option that is asymmetrically dominated. An option is asymmetrically dominated when it is inferior in all respects to one option; but, in comparison to the other option, it is inferior in some respects and superior in others. In other words, in terms of specific attributes determining preferences, it is completely dominated by (i.e., inferior to) one option and only partially dominated by the other. When the asymmetrically dominated option is present, a higher percentage of consumers will prefer the dominating option than when the asymmetrically dominated option is absent. The asymmetrically dominated option is therefore a decoy serving to increase preference for the dominating option. The decoy effect is also an example of the violation of the independence of irrelevant alternatives axiom of decision theory. More simply, when deciding between two options, an unattractive third option can change the perceived preference between the other two.

The decoy effect is considered particularly important in choice theory because it is a violation of the assumption of "regularity" present in all axiomatic choice models, for example in a Luce model of choice. Regularity means that it should not be possible for the market share of any alternative to increase when another alternative is added to the choice set. The new alternative should reduce, or at best leave unchanged, the choice share of existing alternatives. Regularity is violated in the example shown below where a new alternative C not only changes the relative shares of A and B but actually increases the share of A in absolute terms. Similarly, the introduction of a new alternative D increases the share of B in absolute terms. [Wikipedia Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decoy_effect)

## 2. Large Language Models (LLMs)

***2.1 - Let's ask ChatGPT for a generic definition, just to get an idea of the domain.***

**Give me a definition of "Decoy effect"**

The "Decoy Effect" is a cognitive bias that occurs when people's `preferences` for certain `options` change when an irrelevant `third option`, known as the "decoy", is added to the set of `choices`. The decoy is strategically designed to make one of the original `options` more `appealing` and shift people's decision-making in a particular direction.

In many cases, the decoy is inferior to one of the original `options` in terms of value or practicality. Its purpose is to `manipulate` people's perceptions and `influence` their `choices` by making one of the other `options` seem more favorable in comparison.

The Decoy Effect is commonly used in marketing, pricing strategies, and decision-making contexts to `influence` consumer choices and promote specific products or services. By understanding this bias, individuals can become more aware of how their preferences might be manipulated in certain situations and make more informed decisions.

***2.2 - Let's ask to give us some examples of possible scenarios to better understand the context***

**Give me 10 example scenarios of "Decoy Effect"**

Certainly! Here are ten example scenarios of the "Decoy Effect":

1. **Coffee Shop Menu:** A coffee shop `offers` two coffee sizes, "Regular" and "Large." When a `third` size, "Extra Large," is added to the menu with a higher price than the "Large" size but only a slightly larger volume, `customers` are more likely to `choose` the "Large" size, `perceiving` it as a better value `compared` to the overpriced "Extra Large."

2. **Subscription Plans:** A streaming service `offers` two subscription plans, "Basic" and "Premium." To promote the "Premium" plan, a `third` plan, "Deluxe," is introduced with a price close to the "Premium" but offering fewer features. This makes the "Premium" plan appear more attractive due to the presence of the `inferior` "Deluxe" option.

3. **Electronics Pricing:** An electronics store sells two laptops, one priced at $800 and another at $1200. To `encourage` sales of the more expensive laptop, a `third` laptop with limited features is added to the lineup at $1100. `customers` often `choose` the $1200 laptop, considering it a better deal compared to the underperforming $1100 `option`.

4. **Restaurant Menu:** A restaurant has two main courses, "Steak" and "Salmon," priced at $25 each. To influence diners' choices, a `third` `option`, "Surf and Turf" (steak and shrimp), is introduced at $30. The presence of the more expensive "Surf and Turf" prompts many `customers` to opt for the "Steak" `option`, considering it a more appealing choice.

5. **Gym Memberships:** A gym `offers` two membership plans, "Standard" for $50/month and "Premium" for $80/month with additional benefits. To `encourage` sign-ups for the "Premium" plan, a `third` plan, "Super Premium," is introduced at $100/month with minimal extra benefits. Many `customers` are swayed towards choosing the "Premium" plan due to the unattractive "Super Premium" `option`.

6. **Hotel Room Selection:** A hotel `offers` two room types, "Standard" and "Deluxe," priced at $150 and $200 per night, respectively. To nudge guests towards the more expensive "Deluxe" `option`, a `third` `option`, "Superior Deluxe," is introduced at $250 per night, offering few additional amenities. Guests often `choose` the "Deluxe" room, finding it more favorable compared to the overpriced "Superior Deluxe."

7. **Car Dealership:** A car dealership promotes two car models, "Compact" and "Sedan," priced at $20,000 and $25,000, respectively. To influence buyers towards the "Sedan," a `third` model, "Luxury Sedan," is displayed at $30,000. Many `customers` are enticed to select the "Sedan," viewing it as a more economical choice compared to the expensive "Luxury Sedan."

8. **Vacation Packages:** A travel agency `offers` two vacation packages, "Beach Retreat" and "City Getaway," priced at $1500 and $2000, respectively. To increase sales of the "City Getaway," a `third` package, "Ultimate City Escape," is introduced at $2500, providing little extra value. `customers` tend to lean towards the "City Getaway," seeing it as a better `option` compared to the overpriced "Ultimate City Escape."

9. **Mobile Phone Plans:** A phone carrier `offers` two plans, "Basic" and "Premium," priced at $40 and $60 per month, respectively. To `encourage` sign-ups for the "Premium" plan, a `third` plan, "Unlimited Everything," is introduced at $80 per month with only a marginal increase in benefits. `customers` often `choose` the "Premium" plan, considering it a more cost-effective choice compared to the expensive "Unlimited Everything" `option`.

10. **Cinema Ticket Pricing:** A movie theater `offers` two ticket types, "Standard" and "VIP," priced at $12 and $20, respectively. To boost sales of the "VIP" tickets, a `third` `option`, "Platinum VIP," is introduced at $25 with negligible additional perks. Moviegoers are more likely to `choose` the "VIP" tickets, perceiving them as a better value compared to the pricey "Platinum VIP."

In these scenarios, the presence of the decoy option influences people's preferences and decision-making, creating the illusion of a better choice among the original options.

***2.3 - Let's ask for some user story and competency questions***

**Consider the scenario "Subscription Plans" and give me a small user story from it**

**User Story: Selecting the Ideal Subscription Plan**

As a potential subscriber to an online streaming service, I want to `choose` the most suitable subscription plan. The service `offers` two `options`: a "Basic" plan at $9.99 per month and a "Premium" plan at $14.99 per month, with additional features like offline downloads and multiple device access.

I'm initially leaning towards the "Basic" plan due to its lower cost. However, when I see a new plan, "Deluxe Plus," priced at $19.99 per month, offering the same features as the "Premium" plan and exclusive content access, I `reconsider` my decision.

Even though the "Deluxe Plus" plan is more expensive, its presence `influences` me to view the "Premium" plan as a better `value`. I ultimately choose the "Premium" plan, finding it a more appealing `choice` compared to the costly "Deluxe Plus."

By selecting the "Premium" plan, I believe I am getting the features I desire at a reasonable cost. However, I'm aware that my `decision` may have been `influenced` by the decoy effect, prompting me to be cautious when evaluating future `options`.

***We can now derive CQs from the user story***

* CQ1: How do external factors influence decision-making processes in the presence of multiple options?
* CQ2: What are some effective strategies to counteract the influence of external cues and maintain rational decision-making?
* CQ3: In what ways do contextual cues impact an individual's perception of value and attractiveness among available choices?
* CQ4: How does the presence of additional options influence decision-making and alter individuals' preferences among the original choices?

***2.4 - Let's now ask about modeling this bias for an ontology***

**If you should make an ontology of the "Decoy effect", what classes and properties would you create?**

**Classes:**

1. **DecoyEffect:** Represents the cognitive bias known as the Decoy Effect, where the introduction of an additional option influences decision-making and alters individuals' preferences among the original choices.
2. **DecisionInfluencer:** Represents factors or elements that influence an individual's decision-making process, which may include external cues, contextual information, or the presence of a decoy option.
3. **DecisionContext:** Represents the setting or environment in which decision-making occurs, which may include available alternatives, prices, features, or other relevant aspects.
4. **DecisionPreference:** Represents an individual's inclination or preference towards a specific option, which may be influenced by various factors, including perceived value, cost, or benefits.
5. **DecisionOutcome:** Represents the result or choice made by an individual during the decision-making process, which may be influenced by external cues or the presence of a decoy option.

**Properties:**

1. **hasDecoyEffect:** Relates an individual or decision-maker to the DecoyEffect class, indicating that they are affected by the Decoy Effect bias.
2. **influencesDecision:** Relates a DecisionInfluencer to an individual's decision-making process, indicating how external factors, including decoy options, affect choices.
3. **occursInContext:** Relates a DecisionPreference or DecisionOutcome to a DecisionContext, representing the setting or environment where the decision is made.
4. **altersPerception:** Relates a DecisionPreference to a DecisionInfluencer, indicating how external cues, such as the presence of a decoy option, change an individual's perception of available options.
5. **influencesPreference:** Relates a DecisionInfluencer to a DecisionPreference, showing the effect of external factors, including the Decoy Effect, on an individual's inclination towards a particular option.
6. **resultsInOutcome:** Relates a DecisionPreference to a DecisionOutcome, representing the choice made based on an individual's preference.

By including the DecoyEffect class and the hasDecoyEffect property, we explicitly represent the bias and its impact on decision-makers. The ontology becomes more formal and specifically tailored to describe the domain of the Decoy Effect, allowing for more precise representation and analysis of this cognitive bias.

***2.5 - Let's ask for some example of usage of the ontology***

**Can you give me three examples of usage of this classes and properties?**

**Example 1: Decision-Making in a Workplace**

Entities: John (Individual), Manager (Role)
Classes: Individual, DecisionInfluencer, DecisionPreference
Properties: influencesDecision (relates Manager to John), occursInContext (relates John to Manager)

Description: John is an employee in a company, and his manager often influences his decision-making process. The manager, acting as a DecisionInfluencer, provides John with various options for project assignments. The presence of the manager as an influencer impacts John's DecisionPreference, and he tends to consider the options preferred by the manager more favorably. The ontology can represent John as an Individual influenced by the DecisionInfluencer (influencesDecision). It can also capture the context of the decision-making process within the workplace (DecisionContext class) where the manager influences John's choices (occursInContext).

**Example 2: Retail Shopping and Product Choices**

Entities: Sarah (Individual), Retail Store (Context)
Classes: Individual, DecoyEffect, DecisionPreference
Properties: hasDecoyEffect true (for Sarah), altersPerception (relates Retail Store to Sarah)

Description: Sarah visits a retail store to buy a laptop, and she notices a higher-priced laptop with extra features introduced as a decoy option. The presence of the decoy option alters Sarah's perception of value among the original choices. The ontology can represent Sarah as an Individual influenced by the DecoyEffect (hasDecoyEffect true). It can also capture the context of the decision-making process within the retail store (DecisionContext class) and how the introduction of a decoy option impacts Sarah's preferences (altersPerception).

**Example 3: Online Shopping and Subscription Plans**

Entities: Alex (Individual), Subscription Plans (Group)
Classes: Individual, DecoyEffect, DecisionPreference
Properties: hasDecoyEffect true (for Alex), influencesPreference (relates Subscription Plans to Alex)

Description: Alex is considering different subscription plans for an online service, each with varying prices and features. When a new, higher-priced plan with additional benefits is introduced, it influences Alex's preference among the original options. The ontology can represent Alex as an Individual influenced by the DecoyEffect (hasDecoyEffect true). It can also capture the available subscription plans as a group (Subscription Plans class) and how the presence of the decoy option impacts Alex's inclination towards specific plans (influencesPreference).

These examples demonstrate how the classes and properties related to the Decoy Effect can be applied in various scenarios to represent individuals, influencers, preferences, and contextual influences on decision-making.

## 3. Words as Frame Semantic Triggers

To further align the biases with existing semantic frames in Framester, we leverage powerful knowledge extraction tools like QUOKKA's "Concepts Extractor" and FRED.

In QUOKKA, we extracted concepts from the following lexical units:

**- costumer**
**- option**
**- influence**
**- third**

We cross our results with the ones obtained in FRED by putting the following scenario:

1. **Coffee Shop Menu:** A coffee shop `offers` two coffee sizes, "Regular" and "Large." When a `third` size, "Extra Large," is added to the menu with a higher price than the "Large" size but only a slightly larger volume, `customers` are more likely to `choose` the "Large" size, `perceiving` it as a better value `compared` to the overpriced "Extra Large."

By doing these two steps, we selected the following **frames**:

**- Choosing**
**- Possibilities**
**- SubjectiveInfluence**
